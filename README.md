# anophelesmelas_popgen
Anopheles melas population genomic analysis

1. This project has involved sequenced extracted DNA (raw DNA, no added WGA or SWGA)
2. Sequencing has happened multiple times for each sample to get achieve more reads
3. Sequence fastq files for each sample have been combined using SophiesFastqMerge.py 
4. Combined sequences were then checked using check_fastq.sh for fastq file format
5. Sequences were then run 21st June - 24th June using 60 threads on s11 with runfastq2vcf.sh6. There are 45 melas samples in the population
7. Basic satistics were then calculated for each of the run samples
